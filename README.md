# InlineRegexBuilder
Helps build those annoying Regular Expressions inline, so you don't have to!

## What is the Inline Regex Builder?
The InlineRegexBuilder is a simple library built to make the creation and, more specifically, the maintainability of regular expressions easier. Regular expressions are great but editing one inline is tough, so here's a tool to do it for us.

## How do I get started?
It depends, a bit.

If you're looking to get started with Inline Regex Builder - check out the [getting started](https://github.com/tjb042/InlineRegexBuilder/wiki/Getting-Started) wiki page.

If you're looking to get started with Regular Expressions - check out [Regular Expressions Quick Start](http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html)

If you just need a cheat sheet - check out [RegexLib](http://regexlib.com/)

## Where can I get it?
Oh, I'm working on this. There's an old NuGet package for it but it's way out of date. I'll give a shout once it's updated.
